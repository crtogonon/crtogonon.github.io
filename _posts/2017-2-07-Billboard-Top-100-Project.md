For this week's project, I got to work with a data set that I thought was pretty interesting. It contained information for all of the songs that made the Billboard Top 100 in the year 2000. Since most of my favorite music comes from the beginning/early 2000s, I was familiar with almost all of the songs on the list. It was definitely interesting to study the data and see how these songs performed on the chart. As with my last project, I did my work using Python in a Jupyter Notebook.

The dataset I was working with showed the year, artist, track name, song length, genre, the date that it entered the chart, the date that the song peaked, as well as the position number for each week that it was on the chart for each song on the list. After reading in the data set, I first had to clean the data in order to be able to properly do analysis on it. This was probably the most time consuming part of the project Upon examination of the data in its original state, there were a few things that I needed to do. First, the length of the songs were not formatted properly. I ended up taking the information from that column and creating new columns in the dataset that would make it easier for me to do analysis on it, with the most important column being the total length of the song in seconds. Also, I split up the columns for the entered and peaked dates into columns that showed the individual months, days, and years. The dataset also contained a lot of boxes in the week position columns for weeks that songs were not on the chart. They were denoted with asterisks, so I needed to replace those with null values before I could do any work with the data.

After all of that, I was still not done cleaning. I needed to go through the entire list of artist names to make sure that there were no duplicate entries due to misspellings or alternate spellings. Thankfully there were none of those. I also took a look at the genre list, and there were some interesting things going on there. First, I noticed that the genre classifications were pretty weird. I'm not sure what Billboard's classification methodology was back in 2000 but I wouldn't consider a song from an artist like Destiny's Child or Christina Aguilera as "Rock" music. In the end I decided not to edit the classifications because I felt that changing the data only inserts my own bias into the dataset. I may classify Destiny's Child as R&B but someone else may think of them as Pop. Now that I think about it, you could argue that ANY song that makes the top 100 can be considered as "Pop". But that's an entirely different argument. Another issue I found in the genre column was that R&B was listed twice as "R&B" and "R & B". As a big fan of R&B, I was slightly offended by this mistake. It's also not good for my purposes since it could mess up any counts or math I need to do on groupings.

As I mentioned earlier, I added some more columns to the dataset. I needed to make the time, and date columns easier to work with, but I also created some columns that would help me understand the data better. I was able to create columns that shows how many weeks a song was on the chart, it's average postion, as well as its lowest and highest positions. I also created columns that show how many weeks a song spent at number 1, in the top 5, top 10, and top 25.

At this point I felt that I had finally gotten my data to the point where I could do analysis on it. The first thing I did was make a bar chart to see how many of each genre made it into the top 100. I found that the Rock genre had a very large amount of songs that made it. There were over 100. There were 317 songs that made the chart, so this means that about a third of them were from that genre. The next biggest genres were country and rap, which were not really much of a surprise.

Next I made a histogram to see the length of the songs on the chart. I found that a most of the songs that made the top 100 were between 200 and about 270 seconds long. The next thing I was curious about was the entered and peaked months for songs. As I suspected, there were specific months in which songs entered the chart and peaked as well. The months that saw the most of these kinds of activity seemed to line up with the seasons, as I observed peaks in the data in the months of January, April, August/September, and December.

I then took a look at how long songs stayed on the chart and I found something very interesting. Almost 100 songs spent exactly 20 weeks on the chart. I'm not sure what the cause of this would be, but my guess is either something to do with some sort of contract with record labels or radio stations or Billboard has some sort of policy that removes songs from the chart after 20 weeks if certain criteria are met. I also looked at histograms for average, as well as highest and lowest positions for the songs. It looked like some songs have an average position between 20 and 30 but most songs seem to have an average position of 60 or lower. Also, a lot of the songs that make the Top 100 actually make it into the top 10. After that, songs tend to peak in the 20s, 30s, 50s, and 70s. Unsurprisingly, a large amount of songs have a lowest position of 100.

After looking at distributions of the data, I wanted to compare different variables to see if I could find any relationships between certain attributes of songs. In a scatter plot of songth length to highest position there did not appear to be much of a correlation for song lengths up to 350 seconds. However, most of the longer songs made it to at least the top 40. From a separate scatter plot, the average position for songs longer than 350 seconds tended to be between 40 and 80. Another chart showed me that songs tend to enter the Top 100 at higher positions with song lengths between 200 and about 275 seconds. In a chart of entry position against the number of weeks on the chart, I saw once again that a lot of songs spent exactly 20 weeks on the chart, but a lot of songs also had less time than that. One interesting thing I found on that chart was that the three songs that spent the most time in the Top 100 all had an entry position of about 81.

Finally, the last thing I wanted to know about the data was how songs performed over time. To do this I made a line plot. I was most curious about the songs that reached number 1 so I only included them in the chart. There were a total of 17 of them.

I was able to gain some cool insights into the information from looking at this chart. First, it looks like most songs that get to the top spot do so within about 10 to 20 weeks of entering the chart. Also, it looks like a lot of songs get taken off of the chart after they have slipped to the 50th position. The most interesting thing to me about this chart is that there is one song that cimbs into the twenties but slips back down to 50 and disappears from the chart only to reappear about 2 months later and eventually climbs up to number 1. Just like you probably do right now, I HAD to know which song it was. So I looked through the data and found out that it was "Amazed" by Lonestar. You're welcome. 

To cap off my work with this dataset I needed some practice with hypothesis testing. From this data, I decided to test the hypothesis that the average entry position for songs that get to number 1 is the same as the average entry position for all songs that make the top 100. In this situation, the null hypothesis would be that there is no difference between the average 1st week position of songs that made it to number 1 and the average 1st week position of all songs in the top 100. After running my t-test, I ended up with a p-value of approximately 0.00723. Given a significance level of 0.05, this tells me that I would need to reject the null hypothesis and that the average entry position for songs that reach number 1 is likely to be different than the average entry position of the rest of the songs on the list.
